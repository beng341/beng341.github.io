I am interested in experimental connections between social choice and machine learning.
<!-- More generally, I study a variety of topics to do with social choice, machine learning, multiagent systems, game theory, and computational social science.-->

Currently I am exploring how (and whether!) machine learning can be useful for learning about voting rules. I'm particularly focused on what ML models can teach us about existing rules and how they can be used to create new rules.

I have also spent a fair amount of time investigating potential uses for liquid democracy and viscous democracy. This has included considering whether delegation can be used to improve the performance of classifier ensembles in machine learning and uncovering in what settings delegative voting is most accurate.
